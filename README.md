# seqkit_scripts
Shell scripts for working with genome sequence data, drawing primarily on the awesome [SeqKit toolkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/).



## Requirements

* SeqKit
* Gnu Parallel

The above are all easily installed via Conda. Also assumes your system has the standard Unix toolchain such as `sort` and `awk`.

## Installation

Simply put these script in your `PATH` as you would any other shell scripts:

* Download this repo to your system (e.g. `~/gits/seqkit_scripts`)

* Add the repo location to your path (e.g. `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/gits/seqkit_scripts` or add it to your shell profile)
